# Tenebrosity
Tenebrosity game prototype (build v0.2)

A lost youngster takes a stand against the unbridled hatred and ignorance destroying her world. Travel across a strange land filled with Undying, Tainted and Living creatures who all think they are on the right side of the good/evil dichotomy, in an effort to bring them together and show them that, ultimately, we are not so different after all.
